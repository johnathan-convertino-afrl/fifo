\section{Usage}

\subsection{Introduction}

\par
Standard FIFO with multiple options. The FIFO uses a similar interface to the Xilinx FIFO.
It also emulates the Xilinx FIFO bugs and all. This is NOT dependent on Xilinx FPGA's and
can be used on any FPGA supporting the Verilog block ram style primitive.

\subsection{Dependencies}

\par
The following are the dependencies of the cores.

\begin{itemize}
  \item fusesoc 2.X
  \item iverilog (simulation)
  \item cocotb (simulation)
\end{itemize}

\input{src/fusesoc/depend_fusesoc_info.tex}

\subsection{In a Project}
\par
Simply use this core between a sink and source devices. This buffer data from one bus to another. Check the code to see if others will work correctly.

\section{Architecture}

\par
This FIFO is made for three modules. They are the FIFO pipe, FIFO control, and dual clock RAM. The combination of these three provide the FIFO module.
Having it made this way allows for future modules to be customized and brought in to change the FIFO's behavior. The current modules emulate the Xilinx
FIFO IP core availble in Vivado 2018 and up.

\par
FIFO pipe creates a set of pipeline registers for the data interfaces. This helps fix timing issues in the core and pipeline depth can be changed via parameters.

\par
FIFO control is the heart of the core when it comes to how it responds. The logic in the core is designed to emulate the Xilinx FIFO IP.

\par
Dual clock RAM is a universal block RAM core.

Please see \ref{Module Documentation} for more information.

\section{Building}

\par
The FIFO core is written in Verilog 2001. They should synthesize in any modern FPGA software. The core comes as a fusesoc packaged core and can be
included in any other core. Be sure to make sure you have meet the dependencies listed in the previous section.

\subsection{fusesoc}
\par
Fusesoc is a system for building FPGA software without relying on the internal project management of the tool. Avoiding vendor lock in to Vivado or Quartus.
These cores, when included in a project, can be easily integrated and targets created based upon the end developer needs. The core by itself is not a part of
a system and should be integrated into a fusesoc based system. Simulations are setup to use fusesoc and are a part of its targets.

\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\section{Simulation}
\par
There are a few different simulations that can be run for this core.

\subsection{iverilog}
\par
iverilog is used for simple test benches for quick verification, visually, of the core.

\subsection{cocotb}
\par
Future simulations will use cocotb. This feature is not yet implemented.

\section{Module Documentation} \label{Module Documentation}

\par
There is a single async module for this core.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{FIFO} FIFO will buffer data from input to output.\\
\item \textbf{FIFO\_PIPE} FIFO\_PIPE will provide a pipeline for timing issues.\\
\item \textbf{FIFO\_CONTROL} FIFO\_CONTROL emulates the Xilinx FIFO IP interface and its behavior.\\
\end{itemize}
The next sections document the module in great detail.
